I know several ways how I would DRY up my code. Creating a function with three if/else's to put in for my button click events would allow me to use one click event for clicking either button, or selecting an item from the dynamic search list.

If a beer has '&' in the title it screws up my search. I came across at least one like that. Did not have time to fix that issue. I think I would search the string for any offending character like & and would then add the corresponding % value. if anyone is interested in 30th Anniversary - Charlie, Fred & Ken's Bock just type up to the &, dynamic search should do the rest.

if you type too fast the dynamic search gets bogged down and repeats results.
