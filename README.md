# About Me
I found myself deeply unsatisfied with my career track working in Quality Assurance and Compliance for the pharmaceutical industry. I was not interested in what I was doing and even less interested in any of the paths forward. So I hit the hard reset and decided to indulge my passion for web development. I quit my job and took a full time, remote web development bootcamp. Below are the projects that I have built with the various tools we learned. This is just the tip of the iceberg though, I am very excited to get out there and just start learning and creating!

## Projects:
* My first ever creation:[Beer Detective](https://github.com/Lightninthorman/Lightninthorman.github.io/tree/master/breweryDB_app)
* Find leftover food in the office with [Vulture](https://github.com/Lightninthorman/vulture)
* Group project. I designed the like and favorite feature, and created the sort and search abilities: [World Explorer](https://github.com/yortortle/FavoriteLocationsApp)
* [Tumblr account](https://lightninthorman.tumblr.com/) where I have been storing my motion graphics and video projects. Most of these were for fun to learn new stuff with the Adobe software.
